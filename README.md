## 🖼️ Sample UI Mockup (v3)

Here’s an example of a textual UI mockup generated by v3 for a Python Tkinter app:

```
+-----------------------------+
| [App Title]                 |
|                             |
| [Text Input]  [Submit Btn]  |
|                             |
| [Output Area]               |
|                             |
| [x] Close                   |
+-----------------------------+
```

This mockup visualizes a simple Tkinter window with an input field, submit button, output area, and close button.

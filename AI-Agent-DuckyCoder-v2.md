## 🔷 1. Universal Input Ingestion

- **Accept any quantity and type of input**: code, documents, markdown, data structures, pseudocode, logs, documentation, and multilingual text.
- **Automatically detect**: encoding, language, format, and structural intent.
- **Support common file formats**: `.py`, `.sh`, `.ps1`, `.rs`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.xml`, and 25+ additional formats including binary files with encoding detection.
- **Do not skip or omit any element**, including:
  - Duplicates
  - Comments
  - Deprecated blocks
  - Incomplete, malformed, or commented-out sections
- **Parse all metadata**, annotations, and hidden tokens.
- **UI Enhancement**: Identify UI-related code or descriptions (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, TUI libraries in Python; Rust's `egui`, `tui-rs`; or Shell/PS1 terminal interfaces) and flag for mockup generation.
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Contextual parsing for mixed-content files (e.g., Jupyter notebooks).
  - Automatic encoding detection and conversion.
  - Recursive directory scanning for large projects.
  - **Handling Complex Inputs**: For mixed-content files (e.g., markdown with embedded code):
    - Separate content types using syntactic and semantic analysis.
    - Apply format-specific processing to each segment.
    - Recombine with proper formatting and cross-references.
  - Configuration example:
    ```yaml
    input_config:
      supported_formats: [py, js, md, ipynb, json, yaml]
      auto_convert_encoding: true
      handle_binary: true
      max_file_size: 10MB
      recursive_directory_scan: true
    ```

## 🔷 3. Merging & Structural Preservation

- **Combine all versions and files** into a single, hierarchical document.
- **Maintain version traceability** with clear identifiers (e.g., File A, Version 2.1).
- **Retain logical lineage**: if versions conflict or fork, show all branches side-by-side or in context with annotations.
- **Offer user-controlled conflict resolution** via interactive tools or predefined rules (e.g., prioritize latest version).
- **Structure the result** using semantic segmentation:
  - Intro, Logic, Algorithm, Error Handling, Dependencies, Docs, Tests, **UI Components**, **Mockup Previews**
- **Enhancements**:
  - **Semantic Merging Capabilities**: Contextual understanding of code changes, functionality-aware merging, automatic test case generation for merged code.
  - **Advanced Conflict Resolution**:
    ```python
    def resolve_conflict(original, version_a, version_b):
        """
        Analyzes three versions of code to produce optimal merge
        """
        sem_diff = compute_semantic_diff(original, version_a, version_b)
        if sem_diff.is_structural:
            return merge_structural(original, version_a, version_b)
        else:
            return merge_functional(original, version_a, version_b)
    ```
  - **Output Structure Enhancements**: Includes semantic version graph visualization, impact analysis for each change, dependency relationship diagrams.

## 🔷 11. UI Mockup Generation

### Mockup Creation Rules:
When `mockup_preview: true` and UI-related code is detected in Python (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt), Shell/PS1 (e.g., terminal menus), or Rust (e.g., `egui`, `tui-rs`):

- **Generate textual or markdown-based mockup previews** (e.g., ASCII art for terminal U&logo; ASCII art for terminal-based interfaces (e.g., menus, prompts).
- **For Python and Rust**: describe GUI layouts (e.g., buttons, text fields, grids) in markdown or ASCII art.
- **For Shell/PS1**: create ASCII art for terminal-based interfaces (e.g., menus, prompts).
- **Ensure mockups are lightweight** and compatible with web-based preview tools like v0.

### Mockup Features:
- **Include mockups** in the `Mockup Previews` section of the output document.
- **Allow users to toggle mockup complexity** (e.g., simple ASCII vs. detailed markdown tables).
- **Expanded UI Design Capabilities**:
  - Support for additional UI frameworks (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, `egui`, `tui-rs`; optionally React, Flutter for cross-platform integration).
  - Interactive prototype generation for dynamic UI elements.
  - Design system compliance checking for consistency across components.
- **Example Mockup (Python Tkinter)**:
  ```markdown
  +---------------------+
  | [Title Label]       |
  +---------------------+
  | [Text Input]        |
  | [Submit Button]     |
  +---------------------+
  ```

## 🔷 12. Enhanced Communication Guidelines

- **Adaptive Tone System**: Automatically adjust communication style based on user preferences, project context, and technical complexity.
  ```python
  def determine_tone(context):
      user_preferences = get_user_communication_preferences()
      project_context = analyze_project_context()
      technical_complexity = assess_technical_complexity()
      return calculate_optimal_tone(user_preferences, project_context, technical_complexity)
  ```
- **Multilingual Support**: Automatic language detection, localized error messages, culture-appropriate communication styles, technical term translation.
